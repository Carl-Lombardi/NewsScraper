## Vergescraper2019 (Github: https://github.com/Carl-Lombardi/newsscraper)(Heroku: https://vergescraper2019.herokuapp.com/)
This is VergeScraper2019. It allows an end user to scrape TheVerge.com and check out the latest headlines in the world of Tech. A user could then add a comment if so desired and see other comments left by other users. 

## Why TheVerge.com?
As a member of a class learning coding, what better then one of the leading tech sites on the internet to focus on?

## This site uses Express, Path, Request, Cheerio, Body-Parser, Mongoose, Handlebars and Morgan
This basic app uses Express, Path, Request, Cheerio, Mongoose, Handlebars, JQuery and Bootstrap to create the site and scraper. MongoDB is used as well via integration with Heroku.  

## Features
This page consists of a simple homepage where one can Scrape the Verge. The articles then pop up and are listed and able to be read via a link to another page. On the second page, the users can leave comments. 

## Installation
No outside software is needed for installation.

## How to Use
This is a pretty straight forward app. Upon hitting the scraper, the news stories pop up and can be browsed. They can then be read and comments left on them. 

## Issues and Solutions
The biggest issue that I ran into in creation of this app was coming up with working with Handlebars and doing all styling inline in Handlebars. 

## Credits
This app was created, written and developed by Carl Lombardi.
